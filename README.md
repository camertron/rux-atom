## rux-atom

Atom syntax highlighting for [rux](https://github.com/camertron/rux) files.

## Installation

Install as you would any other package by using Atom's package manager.

## Notes

I wrote this plugin by grafting together the Ruby and JSX plugins. It seems to work ok. If you're good with Atom syntax definitions, I would welcome and appreciate any feedback.
